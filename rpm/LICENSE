5. AUDIT RIGHTS. You agree that Extreme may audit Your use of the Licensed Materials for compliance with these terms and Your License Type at any time, upon reasonable notice. In the event that such audit reveals any use of the Licensed Materials by You other than in full compliance with the license granted and the terms of this Agreement, Extreme reserves the right to charge You for all reasonable expenses related to such audit in addition to any other liabilities and overages applicable as a result of such non-compliance, including but not limited to additional fees for Concurrent Users, excess capacity or usage over and above those specifically granted to You. From time to time, the Licensed Materials may upload information about the Licensed Materials and the associated usage to Extreme. This is to verify the Licensed Materials are being used in accordance with a valid license and/or entitlement. By using the Licensed Materials, you
consent to the transmission of this information.

6. RESTRICTION AGAINST COPYING OR MODIFYING LICENSED MATERIALS. Except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, You may not copy or otherwise reproduce the Licensed Materials. In no event does the limited copying or reproduction permitted under this Agreement include the right to decompile,
disassemble, electronically transfer, or reverse engineer the Licensed Materials, including the Licensed Software, or to translate the
Licensed Materials into another computer language. The media embodying the Licensed Materials may be copied by You, in whole or
in part, into printed or machine readable form, in sufficient numbers only for backup or archival purposes, or to replace a worn or defective
copy. However, You agree not to have more than two (2) copies of the Licensed Software in whole or in part, including the original media, in
your possession for said purposes without Extreme’ prior written consent, and in no event shall You operate more copies of the Licensed
Software than the specific licenses granted to You. You may not copy or reproduce the documentation. You agree to maintain appropriate
records of the location of the original media and all copies of the Licensed Software, in whole or in part, made by You. Any portion of
the Licensed Software included in any such modular work shall be used only on a single computer for internal purposes and shall remain

under any bankruptcy law, Extreme may, in addition to any other remedies it may have under law, terminate the License and any other
agreements between Extreme and You.
(a) Immediately after any termination of the Agreement, Your licensed subscription term, or if You have for any reason discontinued

IN NO EVENT SHALL EXTREME OR SUCH OTHER PARTY'S LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PARTY EXCEED THE LICENSE FEE YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSED MATERIALS.
Some states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts and some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation and exclusion may not apply to You. This limited warranty gives You specific legal rights, and You may also have other rights which vary from state to state.
