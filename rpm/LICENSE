  destroy all copies of the Software, including all backup copies, from the
  server and all computers and terminals You own, possess or control and on

4. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

  4.1 EXCLUSION OF WARRANTY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
  MANDATORY LAW, STACKSTORM AND ITS LICENSORS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT ANY
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR IN ANY OTHER
  PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR COMMUNICATION WITH YOU, AND STACKSTORM AND

  ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY
  THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, PRODUCT
  LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
  EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
  DAMAGES, THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. STACKSTORM’S AND
  ITS LICENSORS’ LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT,
  EXCEED THE LICENSE FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY. THE FOREGOING
  LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER STACKSTORM OR ITS LICENSORS
  HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF
  WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
